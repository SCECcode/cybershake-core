UCVM for CyberShake
---------------------

The SVN repository contains the CyberShake-specific query code and the UCVM
install.  In addition, you'll need:

CVM-H 11.2
CVM-S4 

You may also need proj4 if it's not already installed on the target system.

You'll need to compile and install all 5 elements before using the code.
