## Description
CyberShake is a high-performance computational platform developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) to produce seismic hazard models from large suites of earthquake simulations. CyberShake is an integrated collection of scientific software and middleware that performs 3D physics-based probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA).  The CyberShake platform populates a mesh with velocity information for a region of interest, which serves as input to AWP-ODC-SGT, which generates Strain Green Tensors (SGTs).  A catalog of earthquakes is produced by extending a selected earthquake rupture forecast (ERF) by varying the hypocenter location and slip distribution, or using an eERF generated by an earthquake simulator.  Seismic reciprocity is used to calculate synthetic seismograms for approximately 500,000 events per site.  From these seismograms intensity measures (IMs), such as peak spectral acceleration and RotD100, are calculated, as well as duration metrics. IMs are combined with probabilities from the ERF into a PSHA curve for the site of interest.  Hazard curves from hundreds of sites are combined into a hazard map for a region. CyberShake produces a rich suite of layered data that includes PSHA hazard maps, site-specific PSHA hazard curves, large sets of peak amplitude measurements, rupture descriptions, and synthetic seismograms.

## Installation

CyberShake was developed to support ground simulations run on Linux servers and high-performance computing systems, 
so it is designed to compile and run on Linux-based computers. The software included in this repository including the scientific codes used in the CyberShake physics-based PSHA. These can be compiled using recent GNU C, C++, and FORTRAN compilers. Installation of the complete CyberShake workflow system requires software tools in an associated [SCEC CyberShake software tools respository](https://github.com/SCECcode/cybershake-tools) and an HPC software stack including MPI, HPC-Condor, and Pegasus-WMS. Please see the detailed CyberShake software installatations instruction for information about installing the complete CyberShake workflow system.

## Datasets

CyberShake results produced using these cybershake-core programs are available for several large PSHA hazard model datasets. Links to these existing CyberShake datasets are available here:
