New/modified parameters for genslip-v3.2.1:

1) Modify output format by setting:

   write_srf=1
   write_gsf=0

so that the code will directly produce the SRF file without having to make subsequent call
to 'generic_slip2srf'

2) Additional parameters needed for SRF output are:

   stype=$STYPE
   dt=$DT
   risetime=$RISETIME
   plane_header=1
   risetimefac=$RTFAC
   risetimedep=$RTDEP
   risetimedep_range=$RTDEP_RANGE
   rt_scalefac=$RT_SCALEFAC

These should already be defined in the script.

3) The default setting with "write_srf=1" will write to stdout.  So the call to the code
should be something like:

genslip-v3.2.1 read_erf=0 write_srf=1 ... rt_scalefac=$RT_SCALEFAC > $SRFDIR/$SRFFILE

And then remove the subsequent call to 'generic_slip2srf'.

4) Change tapering parameters to:

   side_taper=0.02
   bot_taper=0.0
   top_taper=0.0

These are now the new default settings. At some point, these might need to be made
variables that could be user-specified.

5) Additional new parameters for modifying character of slip along deep bottom portion of
fault:

   slip_water_level=-1
   deep_risetimedep=16.5
   deep_risetimedep_range=1.5
   deep_risetimefac=1.5

These are the default settings. Testing is currently underway to make sure these are
appropriate.  At some point, these might need to be made
variables that could be user-specified.


Also, genslip-v3.2.1 has the capability to generate SRF files for multi-segment faults.
Documentation for multi-segment case is pending.

20131119 RWG:

1) Changes to coding->

   * Changed default/recommended slip rate function to 'Mliu' which is modified version
     of UCSB function.  See gen_Mliu_stf() in srf_subs.c for details.

   * Added parameter 'risetime_coef' which is used to calculate average risetime
     from moment using:

         stfparams.trise = risetime_coef*1.0e-09*exp(log(mom)/3.0);

     This option only works if risetime=-1 which is now the default.

   * Changed default/recommended coefficient for average rise time relation from '1.6'
     to '1.45' =>

         risetime_coef = 1.45

     This can be overridden by specifying as a getper parameter, e.g., for use in
     CEUS, use risetime_coef=3.75

   * Added 'alphaT' parameter for scaling of rise time for dip & rake.  Update of alphaT
     parameter defined by Graves and Pitarka (2010) =>

          alphaT = 1.0/(1.0 + fD*fR*Calpha)

          where Calpha = 0.1   (max value when fD=fR=1.0)

                fD = 1.0 - (dip - 45.0)/45.0      for 45.0 < dip <= 90.0
                fD = 1.0                          for dip <= 45.0
                fD = 0.0                          otherwise

                fR = 1.0 - (|rake - 90.0|)/90.0   for 0.0 <= rake <= 180.0
                fR = 0.0                          otherwise

          Note: should have 0 <= dip <= 90 and -180 <= rake <= 180

     Default for Calpha is 0.1, but can be passed to code as getpar() variable.

   * Added 'alphaT' parameter for scaling of rise time for dip & rake.  Update of alphaT

   * Added random perturbations to tsfac so that it is not 1:1 correlated with slip.
     Perturbations are log normal with ln(sigma)=tsfac_rand*tsfac.  Default for
     tsfac_rand=0.2.

   * Added random perturbations to risetime so that it is not 1:1 correlated with
     sqrt(slip).  Perturbations are log normal with ln(sigma)=rt_rand*trise.  Default
     for rt_rand=0.5.

2) Using default settings, and given an input GSF file, execution of the code
requires only the following parameters:

genslip-v3.3 read_erf=0 \
             write_srf=1 \
             read_gsf=1 \
             write_gsf=0 \
             infile=$GSFDIR/$GSFTEMP \
             mag=$MAG \
             nx=$NX \
             ny=$NY \
             ns=1 \
             nh=1 \
             seed=$SEED \
             velfile=$VELFILE \
             shypo=$SHYPO \
             dhypo=$DHYPO \
             dt=$DT \
             plane_header=1 \
             > $SRFDIR/$SRFFILE

Note that many additional parameters can be optionally specified to alter their default
settings.
