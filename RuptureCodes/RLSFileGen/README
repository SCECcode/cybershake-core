# Registering Ruptures and Rupture Variation Files into the RLS

cd /home/rcf-104/CyberShake/cvs/CyberShake/RLSFileGen

# Run the RLSFileGen_UsingFind.pl perl script to generate a comma separated list of files, their gridftp
# address and their pool attribute.  You need to pass in the path to the rupture variations, the 
# beginning of the gridftp server url, and the pool attribute.  This step will take about 15 minutes 
# for 35,000 ruptures and their variations.

./RLSFileGen_UsingFind.pl /home/rcf-104/CyberShake/RuptureVariations gsiftp://almaak.usc.edu hpc

# Once that finishes use the "bulk-create-in-rls.pl" or "bulk-add-in-rls.pl" scripts to add all of your
# Rupture Variation files into the RLS.  Use create if these files have not been added before at 
# a different site.  If you are not registering to wave you will need to edit this script for your
# RLS server.

./bulk-create-in-rls.pl sdsc-0_20_106.rls
