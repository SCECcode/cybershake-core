NOTES for parameter settings:
0) The order of the above input parameters should not be changed.

1) The number of procs should evenly divide into its respective model
   dimension (e.g., NX/NPX = INTEGER).

2) Expected proc configurations are stacked boxes (e.g., 2X2X2),
   vertical columns (e.g., 4X2X1) or x-normal planes (e.g., 8X1X1).
   The code can be run with only one proc, but would not be as
   efficient as a non-MPI code.

3) The resulting proc size in each direction should be greater then
   the PML thickness (e.g., NX/NPX > ND).  This rule does not apply
   when the Cerjan mode is used.

4) The PML width should not exceed 20.

5) The number of procs requested (outside this program) should be the
   product of the number of procs in each direction (NPX*NPY*NPZ),
   (e.g., 3X3X3 procs does not match 14X2 procs in the batch script).

6) Sources, receivers and the velocity model are all referenced from
   the free surface (z=1) and the south-west corner (y=1, x=1).

7) File names and paths are currently limited to 99 characters without
   modification (change in pmcl3d.f) and recompilation.

8) Waveforms can be altered when using the visco option by changing the
   tau distribution in relax.f (recompilation necessary).

9) The Cerjan ABC option is available for highly heterogenous models
   that cause instability in the PML ABCs.  Typically boundary widths
   are 20 - 50.

10) The ouput is setup for two sets of files; the intention for one 
    being surface recorded seismograms and the other volumes.  Both
    must be regularly spaced, but the specific usage is left up to the
    user.   

11) MU_S and MU_D are only used for dynamic rupture mode

12) output directories are fixed and required

13) Typically, NTISKP2 is used for surface velocity, NTISKP for sliprate 

NOTE for mode settings:
1) mode selection + faultfile/initial stress read
   0 wave propagation mode, use original fault file, works for small-scale *
   1 wave propagation mode, read original fault file and write subgrid-fault
     ! this is used for the case of large scale  !
   2 wave propagation mode, read subgrid-fault fault file
     ! before use 2, need to run 1 first to generate subdomain fault file !
     ! option 1 only separate fault, then exit                            !
   3 dynamic rupture mode, write slip+sliprate+rupture
   4 dynamic rupture mode, write slip+sliprate+rupture + surface velocity

2) checkpoint at every x time step
   0 no checkpoints *
   x every x timestep

3) output options, surface and volume output
   0 only one output at NTISSP time step
      wave propagation mode: only surface outputs
      dynamic mode: only spli/sliprate outputs
   1 only for wave propagation mode
      output at each NTISKP time step - surface
      output at each NTISKP2 time step - volume
     !for dynamic mode, only 0 accepted!

4) MD5 output options
   0 without md5 output *
   1 with md5 output

5) velocity output accumulation
   0 output accumulated and write once at the end of execution
     ! only one file per component for NTISKP/NTISKP2 !
     ! NTISKP/NTISKP2 time steps are skipped          !
   1 output not accumulated
     ! output at each NTISKP/NTISKP2 timesteps        !

6) initial media restart options
   0 homogeneous
   1 read in media file (serial) for small scale
   2 read in media file (mpiio) for large scale but npx*npy*npz>=nz
   3 read in sub-grid media file and pre-process data
   4 read in post-processed sub-grid media file

7) I/O on/off option
   0 not output any data
   1 output surface/volume or slip/sliprate data *

8) Fast initialization (Velocity mesh model)
   0 with regular initialization *
   1 fast initialization (homogeneous)

9) Performance measurement on/off option
   0 not output timing measurments
   1 output timing measurements *
     ! including initialization/computing/I/O/total time !

10) IDYNA: mode selection of dynamic rupture model
   0 Stress glut (SG) method (previous version, only for pure strike slip)
   1 Staggered Grid Split Node (SGSN)(new version) (general slip)

11) SOCALQ: Southern California Vp-Vs Q relationship enabling flag
   0: Southern California Vp-Vs Q relationship disabled *
   1: Southern California Vp-Vs Q relationship enabled

* default case
